# Image Noise Reduction using Autoencoders
Noise is an abrupt change in in the pixel value in an image.
### Type of noises
- Amplifier Noise (Gaussian Noise)
- Salt and Pepper Noise (Impulse Noise)
- Quantization Noise (Uniform noise)
- Shot Noise

## Autoencoder
Autoencoders are neural network designs that are made up of two sub-networks, encoder and decoder networks, that are linked by a latent space. The Encoder encodes the feature data into the lantent space which is then used by the decoder to convert it back to feature data. As a result, generating an optimal latent space is an important aspect of autoencoder training.
